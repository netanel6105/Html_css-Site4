                <h1>This is Rio de Janeiro</h1>
                <p>Known to Brazilians as "Cidade Maravilhosa" (The Wonderful City),
                    Rio de Janeiro is always brimming with color, sound, rhythm, and
                    joy, which make it synonymous with Carnival, happiness, and
                    beautiful people. Very few places in the world match the hospitality
                    and natural charm in which Rio is perpetually swathed. It is the
                    second largest city in Brazil, on the South Atlantic coast; famous
                    for its breathtaking landscape, its laid back beach culture and its
                    annual carnival. Although, their soccer skills here are very well
                    recognized. Rio de Janeiro is well known for the beauty of its beaches and of its peaks, ridges, and
                    hills—all partly covered by tropical forests. The city is a centre of leisure for Brazilian and
                    foreign tourists, and people wearing bathing suits can be seen walking in the streets and along the
                    beaches or traveling on the city's buses. Perhaps at no time is the city's festive reputation better
                    displayed than during the annual pre-Lenten Carnival, which enlivens the city night and day with
                    music, singing, parties, balls, and street parades of brilliantly costumed dancers performing to
                    samba rhythms. It is also an important economic centre, however, with activities ranging from
                    industry and national and international trade to administration, banking, education, culture, and
                    research.</p>

                    <p>Copacabana, often referred to as the world's most famous beach, it is mostly know for holding the
                        annual festival known as "Reveillon", which is celebrated at the last day of the year, where a
                        countdown happens to celebrate the New Year.</p>

                    <p>Tijuca Forest is located in the heart of Rio de Janeiro. The access is possible from North, South
                        and West zone of the City. The forest is the biggest urban forest in the world, with an
                        extension of almost 4.000 hectare of Atlantic Forest.</p>

                    <p>Few iconic stadiums in the world can rightly claim to be genuinely historical monuments as well
                        as sporting arenas. It is popularly known as Estadio Mario Filho, with its enormous expanse,
                        colossal seating capacity, and majestic architecture, is one of them.</p>
